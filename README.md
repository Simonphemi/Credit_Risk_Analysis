# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Through this project, we use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. We applied ML methods as follows:

Oversampling using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
Undersampling using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
A combination approach of over-undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
The BalancedRandomForestClassifier algorith.
The EasyEnsembleClassifier algorith.
